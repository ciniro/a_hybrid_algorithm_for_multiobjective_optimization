# A hybrid algorithm for multiobjective optimization based on Diferenttial Evolution, Kmeans and NSGA II

A hybrid algorithm for multiobjective optimization based on Differential Evolution, Kmeans, and NSGA II developed by me during my master's course. Details on implementation, application, and results can be found in an article available in the XIII Brazilian Congress of Computational Intelligence proceedings. The event took place in Niter√≥i, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, between 30-10-2017 and 01-11-2017.

If you use this material, quote it as described in the proceedings of the XIII Brazilian Congress of Computational Intelligence (available in http://cbic2017.org).
