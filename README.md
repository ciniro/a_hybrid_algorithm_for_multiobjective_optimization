# A hybrid algorithm for multiobjective optimization based on Diferenttial Evolution, Kmeans e NSGA II

A hybrid algorithm for multiobjective optimization based on Diferenttial Evolution, Kmeans e NSGA II developed by me during my master´s course. Details about implementation, application and results can be seen in an article available in the annals of the XIII Brazilian Congress on Computational Intelligence. Event occurred in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil between the days 2017-10-30 and 2017-11-01.

If you use this code, please cite as described in the proceedings of the XIII Brazilian Congress of Computational Intelligence (available in http://cbic2017.org)
